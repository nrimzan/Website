<h2>Journey of a fella that were late to the party.</h2>

What if I learn HTML and CSS and Bootstrap (maybe Javascript too) at the same time I'm making a website?

Day 5 (I think) 
<br>
Scrapped a lot of css

Day 7 (I think)
<br>
Colours!

Day uhh 9?
Started learning JS cause the competition is tough out here
