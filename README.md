<h2>Journey of a fella that were late to the party.</h2>

What if I learn HTML, CSS and Javascript at the same time I'm making a website?

This is a simple static website just for the love of the game.

<dt>Day 5 (I think)</dt>
<dd>Scrapped a lot of css</dd>

<dt>Day 7 (I think)</dt>
<dd>Colours!</dd>

<dt>Day uhh 9?</dt> 
<dd>Came to conclusion that there will be no javascript for the sake of my sanity</dd>

<dt>Day 100 (true)</dt>
<dd>FINALLY</dd>
